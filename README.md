Pluggable /Extendable UI Demo
------------------------------

##Overview

A small wacky demo of simple Client APIs and how to use Events to share data.   
 
###How it works 
 1. The parent page animates elements
 2. On animation end for all elements we trigger an event
 3. The event propagates to the iFrames with a random chosen animal
 4. That animal plays a sound and changes his background color to Fuchsia
 
 The demo relies on [Liveperson Chronos JS](https://github.com/LivePersonInc/chronosjs) for all events.
